Week 7
Please describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

I come across forms everyday when searching the web. These forms include things like:
When loging into any online account
When asked to join a mailing list
when checking out of an online store
Forms are used anywhere the site is asking for user input of any type.
