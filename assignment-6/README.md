Please describe the difference between semantic and structural markup.

Semantic Markup conveys the type of information of each element in your document with proper selection of markup elements to maintain separation between markup and visual presentation. Semantic Markup tells the browser something about the contents of the elements in your code. Writing and creating your HTML so that it reinforces the semantics (meaning) of the content rather than its appearance.

Structural Markup gives information about the structure of the site. These would be like headings, paragraphs, and lists.

The two seperate the content from the presentation.
