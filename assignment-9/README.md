Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

I learned HTML years ago. Most of which I had forgotten. I think for me the most interesting part of HTML and when we get into table and navigation. People do not realize the work that goes into building websites. The most difficult thing to learn for me is remember the codes so I do not have to keep looking them up. This will change with time and practice.

After we come back from spring break we will start to dive into CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?

I am really looking forward to CSS. When I originally learn how to build website years ago we never got into CSS much. For me as a designer it kills me when things look basic. HTML provides the structure but very little esthetics. I look forward to making our sites more pleasing to the eye.

This is a site I would like to build on. The content on the site is very basic at this point and I hope to really develop the site.
