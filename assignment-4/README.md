Very briefly detail how browsers function.

Browsers are software programs used by end users to access the internet from devices. Browsers are what allow the end user to see what the developers and designers have created in a visually appealing way instead of the markdown content.
The browser directs actions between the User Interface and the Rendering Engine, and external communications with servers.

I am a Chrome girl all the way. I love Chrome I do not usually look at other browsers. I am slightly curious about Microsoft Edge but have not taken the time to explore.
