Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

id selector can only style one element as specified by the id
class selector uses elements with specific class across the HTML page and styles multiple elements with that class value
element selector selects elements based on element names
Universal selector selects all the elements on the document

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?
I am drawn to cool colors so I chose some of my favorites for my portfolio. I plan to add additional hues of the teal and purple along with some pink.

Optional: discuss any challenges you faced this week, and how you overcame them.
