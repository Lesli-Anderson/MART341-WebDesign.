Week 5

Tell me about a website you visited using the Wayback Machine. What year is it from?

    I visited amazon.com on June 10, 2001. The site on this date is a huge difference from today's site aesthetics and appeal of the site.

How is the older version different from the current version today in terms of its overall design?

    The Amazon website design feels very messy. Most of the links are highlighted text and not in the form of buttons. Very little hierarchy in the design. Most of the content seems to run together. Very few images and the images that are there are mostly Clipart. Very basic website with no moving elements.

    Today's site has appealing sliders and a live video feed of someone highlighting Amazon products. The site has beautiful images of the products being sold and there is very little text. Large headers and visual hierarchy are present in how Amazon would like you to spend your money as well as a cookie algorithm that is dedicated to your interests, making sure items of your interest present themselves on the home page that you open.
