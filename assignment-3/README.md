Week 3
Questions regarding your understanding of the Topicâ€™s materials.
//I enjoyed the videos this week. I felt they broke the conent up into chewable parts and brought it back together at the end.

Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.
//This week I really tried to make sure my files are clearly organize so there will be no interuptions in the path.

Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
//I have a better understanding of the internet now. Some of the content was review but on a much deeper level of understanding.

What problems did you have? How did you solve them?
//I was struggling to clone my repository. I find myself getting mixed up in the content between MART 341 and MART 441. I thought I had already cloned 341 and I had not. I went back to my 441 to remeber the steps since I had already created my GitHub account and linked my Visual Studio Code. All is good now. Just had to slow down and retrace my steps a bit.
