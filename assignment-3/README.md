Week 3 - Lesli Anderson, author
Working through week 3 content for MART 341.

Thoughts from this week.

**Questions regarding your understanding of the Topicâ€™s materials.**

I enjoyed the videos this week. I felt they broke the conent up into chewable parts and brought it back together at the end.

**Summarizing the work you did this cycle, paying particular attention to the individual choices you made.**

This week I really tried to make sure my files are clearly organize so there will be no interuptions in the path.

**Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?**

I have a better understanding of the internet now. Some of the content was review but on a much deeper level of understanding.

**What problems did you have? How did you solve them?**

I was struggling to clone my repository. I find myself getting mixed up in the content between MART 341 and MART 441. I thought I had already cloned 341 and I had not. I went back to my 441 to remeber the steps since I had already created my GitHub account and linked my Visual Studio Code. All is good now. Just had to slow down and retrace my steps a bit.

**Tell me three things you have learned in this class so far.**

I have learned the importance of file organization in terms of creating clear paths for web development.
Also, I now have a much better understanding of what the Internet is, how it functions, and the difference from the World Wide Web.
Last but not least that markup language is written in Markdown.
