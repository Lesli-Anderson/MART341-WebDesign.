I decided to recreate my site. I wasn't liking where it was going and looked to W3.CSS Templates for some styling assistance. From that point I was able to manipulate what I wanted the site to look more like.

TO DO - Next Steps:

link pages to stylesheets,
add gallery images,
replace current gallery images and build page,
correct code for logo,
finish updating home page and make others follow style and theme,
make sure each page is responsive,
update and change about page,
