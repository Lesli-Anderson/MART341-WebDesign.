How did your user testing sessions go?
Due to my schedule I have been unable to complete my site and conduct the usability tests at this time. I plan on having these conducted and changes made prior to the next submission date for the final. I apologize for the incomplete work.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
I will include the findings and adjustments made in the final submission.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?

I decided to recreate my site. I wasn't liking where it was going. I found a tutorial that I liked and went from there.
I feel that part of the issue I was having is that I was pulling code from different assignments to create a new portfolio. This created a bit of a mess for me as I was getting my code mixed up, causing the site to behave incorrectly. I like where my site is going now. This is more something I can be proud of.

2 Users tested my website the following is their feedback:

    User 1: Photographer/Designer; Visits a variety of websites; 5+ hours a day on the internet
            Feedback:
                "I like the feature of the hover boxes, but I think they need to move up slightly slower."I really like the logo layout, but the grey throws me off. Maybe a lighter background.
                "As far as the clicking it is fast enough."

    User 2: Teacher; Visits a variety of websites; 2+ hours a day on the internet
            Feedback:
                "I really like all the features. The change in highlighted text throughout the site is amazing."
                "I also like how you organized your site in categories and made it simple to navigate."
                "Awesome color scheme and easy to read."
                "On the Portfolio page I would suggest adding a title for your logos, like you did with the videos."
                "On your services page, I would like the picture of the pencil/ruler to be moved up just a bit because when it turns purple, the image is too close to the text."
