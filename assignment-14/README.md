I decided to recreate my site. I wasn't liking where it was going. I feel that partly was because I was pulling code from different assignments and I was getting my code mixed up.

TO DO - Next Steps:

link pages to stylesheets,
add gallery images,
replace current gallery images and build page,
correct code for logo,
finish updating home page and make others follow style and theme,
make sure each page is responsive,
update and change about page,
